Use only at your own risk.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How?</h2>\n<p>You send some text to Instabot Trader, with a list of actions to execute. It reads the\nmessage and looks for actions you want to execute on supported exchanges.</p>\n<p>Each message looks a bit like this...</p>\n<pre><code>Any text you like here...\n\nexchangeName( instrument ) {\n    action1(value1, value2);\n    action2(value1, value2);\n}\n\nYou can have more action lists here, so you can execute commands\non several exchanges at the same time.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Give us a simple example...</h2>\n<p>OK, lets place a limit order at Bitfinex to buy 1 BTC. We'll put the\nbid in $50 below the current price...</p>\n<pre><code>bitfinex(BTCUSD) { limitOrder(side=buy, amount=1btc, offset=50); } \n</code></pre>\n<p>or how about place a scaled order on Bitmex. Same amount, but lets\nspread it over 25 orders from $20 below the current price, down to $70\nbelow the current price...</p>\n<pre><code>Scaling in on mex...\nbitmex(XBTUSD) { \n  scaledOrder(side=buy, amount=1btc, from=20, to=70, orderCount=25); \n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>Easy.</p>\n<h2>But how do I send these messages?</h2>\n<p>If you use TradingView, set up an alert that triggers when you want to trade.\nSet the Alert Message to your list of actions. Change a couple of settings\nin TradingView and then you'll trigger some actions every time that alert fires.\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n(see the setup and config sections below for details on setting this up).</p>\n<p>Instabot Trader listens for messages sent to it over the web, so anything\nthat can make HTTP requests will be able to trigger the bot to execute\ntrades for you. It's possible to set it up to respond to emails, SMS messages\nand loads more - see the setup guide for more details.</p>\n<h2>Which exchanges are supported?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bitfinex.com/\">Bitfinex</a> - Spot Exchange</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/reg-1657.8470\">Deribit</a> - Bitcoin Futures</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bitmex.com/register/LWpOVZ\">Bitmex</a> - 100x degen trading</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"api-setup\">Setup Guide</h1>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>Requires <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a></strong>. Tested on Node V8.7.0</p>\n<p>Clone or copy the source code to a new folder, then...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd instabot-trader\n$ npm install\n$ npm run setup\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Edit the config</h3>\n<p>The last command above should have created a config file for you.\nOpen <code>config/local.json</code> in your favourite editor.</p>\n<p>There are several sections here that you can adjust...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credentials</strong> - add the API keys for each of the exchanges you want to trade on to this section</li>\n<li><strong>SMS</strong> - Instabot Trader has a built in Twilio integration. If you have a Twilio account you can set\nup the credentials, 'from' phone number and your phone number to send alerts to.</li>\n<li><strong>Slack</strong> - You can have notifications sent to a slack channel. Set up the webhook here.</li>\n<li><strong>Server</strong> - here you can change the URL that your server is accessed from, and the port that it listens on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'll need to get an API key and secret from each of the exchanges you want to trade on.\nOnce you have these, update <code>local.json</code> with them and you're ready to start.</p>\n<h3>Launch for the first time</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm run start\n\n=================================================\n\n  Instabot Trader bot starting  ü§ñ  üöÄ  üåî  üèéÔ∏è \n\n=================================================\n\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Set up TradingView</h2>\n<p>So that you can execute trades on any alert from TradingView.</p>\n<h2>Set up an Email listener</h2>\n<h2>Set up an SMS listener</h2>\n<h2>Set up a tunnel to a home computer</h2>\n<h2>Set up PM2 to ensure your new bot stays running.</h2>\n<h2>How to write messages</h2>\n"  },  "sampleUrl": false,  "defaultVersion": "0.0.0",  "apidoc": "0.3.0",  "generator": {    "name": "apidoc",    "time": "2018-10-04T20:28:52.321Z",    "url": "http://apidocjs.com",    "version": "0.17.6"  }}
