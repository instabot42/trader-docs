<h1 id="api-intro">Introduction</h1>

**Instabot Trader ü§ñ** helps you to automate placing complex trades on a selection of exchanges.

Trigger your trades from...

* **TradingView alerts**
* **Telegram**
* Anything that can send an HTTP request (A simple web form, Zapier, 
  email routers like Mailgun, SMS routers like Twilio, etc).
* even from the command line, if that's your thing.

Place simple limit orders or complex sequences of trades...

* **Scaled orders**, even on exchanges that don't offer this (like Bitmex and Deribit)
* **Stepped market orders** (a series of market orders spread over a period of time)
* Basic limit, market and stop orders
* Send yourself notifications (**SMS**, **Slack** and **Telegram**) of progress and account balances / status.
* Chains of the above (for example, scaled order, wait a while, cancel unfilled orders, 
  replace with market orders etc)
  
Do you fear the dredded 'system overload' messages on Bitmex. Instbot Trader will repeatably 
retry your orders to maximise the chance of them getting through the log jam.

## What does it do? How does it work?

You send some text to Instabot Trader. The text contains commands. 
The commands are are converted into suitabled API calls to an exchange. Orders are placed. Lambos!

Each message looks a bit like this...

```
Any text you like here...
Want this text sent as an SMS to your phone? 
then add this somewhere-> {!}

Next, we have a set of actions that 
will be executed on an exchange...

exchangeName( instrument ) {
    action1(value1=x, value2=y);
    action2(value1=x, value2=y);
}

You can have more action lists here, so you can execute commands
on several exchanges at the same time.
```

## Give us a simple example...

OK, lets place a limit order at Bitfinex to buy 1 BTC on the BTCUSD pair. We'll put the
bid in $50 below the current price...

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) { limitOrder(side=buy, amount=1btc, offset=50); } 
```

or how about place a scaled order on Deribit's perpetual swap (BTC-PERPETUAL). Same amount, but lets
spread it over 25 orders from $20 below the current price, down to $70
below the current price...

```
Scaling in on perps...
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) { 
  scaledOrder(side=buy, amount=1btc, from=20, to=70, orderCount=25); 
} 
```

Easy. You'll find **[more examples here...](#api-examples)**

## But how do I send these messages?

If you use TradingView, set up an alert that triggers when you want to trade.
Set the Alert Message to the commands you'd like to execute, like the examples above. 
Change a couple of settings
in TradingView and then you'll trigger some actions every time that alert fires.
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
(see the setup and config sections below for details on setting this up).

Instabot Trader listens for messages sent to it over the web, so anything
that can make HTTP requests will be able to trigger the bot to execute
trades for you. It's possible to set it up to respond to emails, SMS messages
or to build a simple html page that sends commands when you click a button. 
See the setup guides for more details. 

By default the bot listens at `http://localhost:3000/trade`, though both the port and path
can be configured in the config.

`POST` messages to this URL, with your message in value called `message`, `subject` or `Body`.

```
curl --data-urlencode "message=hello world" http://localhost:3000/trade
```

<h1 id="api-setup">Setup Guide</h1>

## Installation

You'll need **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** v10.3.0 or better to run Instabot Trader.

So, clone or copy the source code to a new folder, then...

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instabot42/instabot-trader.git
$ cd instabot-trader
$ npm install
$ npm run setup
```


### Edit the config

The last command above should have created a default config file for you.
Open `config/local.json` in your favourite editor.

There are several sections here that you can adjust...

* **Credentials** - add the API keys for each of the exchanges you want to trade on to this section
* **SMS** - Instabot Trader has a built in Twilio integration. If you have a Twilio account you can set
            up the credentials, 'from' phone number and your phone number to send alerts to.
* **Slack** - You can have notifications sent to a slack channel. Set up the webhook here.
* **Telegram** - If you want to talk to Instabot Trader from Telegram, you'll need to create a bot
                 (see [the botFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)) and add the botToken
                 to the config. Once you've done that, start a chat with your new bot and have it send
                 messages executed instantly. See the section on Telegram for the commands and shortcuts.
* **Notifications** - Set up the default notification channel (or channels) and control if you get sent a 
                notification when Instabot Trader starts up.                  
* **Server** - here you can change the URL that your server is accessed from, and the port that it listens on
* **Macros** - See the section on macros for more details. TLDR; define long lists of commands and trigger the 
            whole list with a single new command. 

You'll need to get an API key and secret from each of the exchanges you want to trade on.
Once you have these, update `local.json` with them and you're ready to start.   


### Launch for the first time

```bash
$ npm run start

=================================================

  Instabot Trader bot starting  ü§ñ  üöÄ  üåî  üèéÔ∏è 

=================================================

```

That's it, you're up and running...
<br><br>
**Very strongly recommend that you start out using very small amounts until you've figured it all out.**
**Even better, start by using only the wait() command, which won't place any trades.**

# Advanced Setup (for full automation)

This section covers setting up a secure tunnel, an Email-to-bot service, TradingView email alerts etc. Basically,
all these bits together can help you set up the bot so it can automatically trade from alerts triggered in 
TradingView, or from other services.

Ideally you'd host this on a proper server, which makes a several of the steps below unnecessary, but is 
technically harder if Devops isn't your thing.   

## Setting things up so you can run the bot from home

If you are planning on running the bot at home or from behind a firewall, and don't know how to (or can't) set up
port forwarding on the network, then you'll need to create a secure tunnel. 

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a great way to do this. Download it and set up a tunnel from a public url to 
your server like so...

```bash
ngrok http -bind-tls=true 3000
```

Where 3000 is the port number in your config files.

This will show you the public address that you can use to access your bot from outside your network. 
The main problem with this is that you'll get a different URL each time you run the command, which can be 
inconvienient, especially when trying to link this up to other services.

However, for a $5 a month you can have a fixed domain that you can use every time, which is much better. You start 
it a bit like this...

```bash
ngrok http -subdomain=myNewSubDomain -bind-tls=true 3000
```
  
I've kept these running for months at a time with no problems at all.


## Set up an Email listener

There are many services out there that can receive emails and make an HTTP request with the details of the message.
You can use one of these to enable a method of converting emails into automated trades. This is especially useful
when trying to trigger trades from TradingView, as it offers an option to send alerts via email for free.

Here we'll cover setting up MailGun to do this, though you can use any service you are familiar with.

* Create an account at [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
* Ideally set up a spare domain so MailGun handles its email. You do get a sandbox domain from Mailgun for free
  but there are more limits on this and it may not be suitable.
* Go to the `Routes` section and add a new Route. These are used to filter incoming email and then forward
  them on to a new destination. You can filter by from address, or a secret code you add to all the messages you 
  want to be forwarded to the bot.
* In the action for the Route, make sure you tick 'forward' and enter the full URL for your bot. If your bot
  is running at home behind a firewall, you'll need to have set up a tunnel first (see above).
* Save the rule and test it out. Any email you send to the address that matches you filtering settings should 
  end up making a call to your bot if it is running and accessible from Mailguns servers.
   

## Set up TradingView

TradingView has a very powerful alerting system, allowing you to trigger an alert when any combination of
indicators do something you consider important. You can also write your own indicators in PineScript and have
those fire alerts when interesting things happen too.

TradingView will let you set up either a phone number for SMS alerts, or an email address for what it 
calls SMS emails (I think this is meant to enable you to use an email to SMS service, as TradingView has a 
hard limit of only 500 SMS's, even on their most expensive account).

I recommend using the SMS Email option, as there are no usage limits and it's just as easy to hook up 
an email-to-bot service as it is an SMS-to-bot service.

Go to your TradingView settings page, and enter the SMS email address in the Private Details section
of the page. You'll also need to set up that email address so it is forwarded to your bot, but there are
some tips on doing this above.


## Set up SMS

This is actually pretty simple. 

* Create a Twilio account
* To be able to send SMS messages out (for alerts or account updates), grab the API Credentials from 
  the Programmable SMS section and put these into your `config/local.json`, along with the number you'd
  like the messages to be sent to.
* To receive SMS messages that are routed to Instabot Trader, create a new number and set it up 
  to call a webhook when a message comes in. Enter the URL for your server and set it to HTTP POST.
  Any SMS sent to that number will be passed on to your server now.


## Set up Slack

* In slack create a new Webhook URL to send messages to the channel you want and paste it into the 
    `config/local.json` (slack -> webhook). 
   
  
## Set up Telegram

Before you can use the Telegram integration you'll need to create a telegram bot. Don't worry, it's
easier than it sounds...

* First, in Telegram, you'll need to start a chat with @botFather to create your own chat bot token. 
  There are detailed instructions at 
  [https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).
* Once you have a token, you can add it to the config in `config/local.json` and restart Instabot Trader.
* Now you can start a chat with your new bot. Type `/help` for the help text.
* Anything you say to the telegram bot will now to sent directly to Instabot Trader and will be treated
  as a regular message (commands and all).
* To make things even simpler you can create some shortcuts that you can trigger 
  Telegram using `/shortcut <name>`. The shortcuts are defined in your `config/local.json` as an array
  of objects. The example below can be executed using `/shortcut example`...
  
```
{ 
    "name": "example", 
    "message": "Testing... bitfinex(BTCUSD) { wait(5s); } "
}
```

## Notifications

* **alertOnStartup** should be true or false. If true, a notification will be sent each time 
        Instabot Trader starts.
* **default** is an array containing the names of the channels to send messages to. If you provide
        more than one channel, messages will be sent to all listed channels.

<h1 id="api-format">Message Format</h1>

When a message is received, the following elements are looked for...

### {!}

An explanation mark in curly brackets tells Instabot Trader to take all the text that is not
part of a command / action list and send it to your default notification channel (notification channels
are configured in your `local.json` config).

This is great for simple alerts. For example, set up an alert in TradingView when the 
price crosses an important line and set the alert text like this...

```
BTC now over 10K! {!} 
```

You'll get a message 'BTC now over 10K!' sent to you on your configured channels (SMS, Slack or Telegram). 
There are no commands in the message, so that's all that will happen.

### Actions and commands

You can have as many of these as you like in a message. This makes it possible to trigger something
that will happen on multiple exchanges, or on multiple pairs/instruments on an exchange. 
All the exchange blocks are executed simultaneously, allowing
you to be placing orders on different exchanges / pairs at the same time. The commands inside each block
are executed one at a time.

Lets look at an example and break it down so you can understand all the parts...

```
Going Long {!}

bitfinex(BTCUSD) {
   limitOrder(side=buy, amount=1, offset=5);
   notify(msg="Order placed, on Bitfinex, for 1 BTC");
}

deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) {
   scaledOrder(position=10000, from=0, to=50, orderCount=30);
   wait(30m);
   cancelOrders(session);
   marketOrder(position=10000);
}
```

First up, we'll get sent an SMS with the message 'Going Long'.

Next, there are 2 blocks. One will target Bitfinex and the second will target Deribit to place orders. Both will
be executed at the same time.

The Bitfinex blocks starts by indicating which pair to trade on (BTCUSD in this example). The list of actions
to run on the Bitfinex BTCUSD pair are contained between the open and close curly brackets. Each action looks
like a function call. It starts with the name of the command, then a list of parameters inside brackets. 
An optional semi-colon can be seen in the example too.

The arguments are all named (meaning they all take the form of `name = value`)and can be listed in any order.
Each parameter is separated by a comma. The Bitfinex limitOrder action in the example above has 3 parameters - 
`side`, `amount` and `offset`. You'll notice that the `notify` action uses double quotes around it's value.
This is necessary as the value contains commas, but is optional if it does not.

The actions in the block are executed one at a time. So in the Bitfinex example, the first command is
a limitOrder command. Note that it does not wait for the order to
be filled - it only waits until the order has been submitted and accepted by the exchange. Once the limit
order has been placed, it moves on to the second action (sending a notification (SMS, Slack and Telegram supported)).

The Deribit example shows this ordering more clearly. It will attempt to get into a position cheaply
using limit orders over a small price range. It will give this 30 minutes to work, then fall back to a market
order to finalise the position if any of the limit orders were still unfilled.

First we place a scaled order, which actually results
in Instabot Trader placing 30 separate limit orders. How long this takes depends on the rate limits at the
exchange and for your account (Deribit has pretty high limits, so can probably place all the orders in a
fraction of a second. The same command on Bitfinex would take a lot longer to execute as it has much lower
rate limits). Once all the orders are placed, it goes on to the second action, which just waits for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes it will cancel any outstanding orders that were created by the scaled order action and finally
place a market order to get us fully into position. 


---------


<h1 id="api-macros">Macros</h1>

In your `config/local.json` file you can define macros. These are simple shortcuts to a list of
commands to execute and lets you define your own commands.

Each macro looks a bit like this...

```
{
    "name": "myAction",
    "actions": [ "limitOrder(position=1, offset=5);", "balance()"]
}
```

So this defines a macro called `myAction` that will execute 2 commands (the limitOrder and balance commands shown).
You can use it like this...

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) { myAction(); }
```

So why bother? It means shorter messages which can be really useful when they are set up in places that are hard
to change or update. Instead you can just update the config and restart the bot and you get the new command 
sequence next time the macro is triggered. It also means you don't need to reveal exactly what orders etc you'll
be executing to the service that is triggering the action. 


<h1 id="api-examples">Examples</h1>

#### Place a market order to buy 1 btc

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) {
    marketOrder(side=buy, amount=1)
}
```

#### Adjust your open position so you own 1 btc, using a market order

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) {
    marketOrder(position=1)
}
```

#### Place a limit order at $10 below the current price

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) {
    limitOrder(side=buy, amount=1, offset=10);
}
```

#### Adjust your open position so you own 1 btc using a limit order

```
bitfinex(BTCUSD) {
    limitOrder(position=1, offset=10);
}
```

#### Kill everything - close all orders and close open positions

This works by cancelling all open orders and aiming for an open position of 0 contracts. 
If the account was long, this would turn into a market sell. If short, a market buy. 
If there were no open positions, no trade would be placed.

```
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) {
    cancelOrders(all);
    marketOrder(position=0);
}
```

#### Get your balance at Bitfinex and Deribit

Notification will be sent to your preferred channel (one or many of SMS, Telegram or Slack)

```
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) { balance() }
bitfinex(BTCUSD) { balance() }
```

#### Just send a message

(to your preferred notification channels)

```
This text will be sent to SMS, Telegram or Slack {!}
```

#### Enter a long position of 10,000 contracts over a period of time

A more complex example. This will place 30 limit orders over a $50 range,
with the aim of ending up 10,000 contracts long. After 30 minutes, cancel
anything not yet filled and place a new range of orders in a tighter range
close to the current price again. Wait again, cancel anything not filled again
and finally market buy any missing contracts. At the end, send a balance
report. The whole sequence will take around 1 hour to complete.

```
Going Long {!}
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) {
    scaledOrder(from=0, to=50, orderCount=30, position=10000, tag=firstGo);
    wait(duration=30m);
    cancelOrders(which=tagged, tag=firstGo);
    scaledOrder(from=0, to=20, orderCount=30, position=10000, tag=secondGo);
    wait(duration=30m);
    cancelOrders(which=tagged, tag=secondGo);
    marketOrder(position=10000);
    balance();
}
```

#### Open a short position and set a stop loss $100 higher

```
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) {
    marketOrder(position=-1000);
    stopMarketOrder(side=buy, amount=1000, offset=100);
}
```


#### Place a series of market orders over a 10 minute period

This will be done using 20 market orders at 30 second intervals. Once
the sequence is complete you will have an open position of 1000 contracts
(regardless of what your open position was at the start)

```
deribit(BTC-PERPETUAL) {
    steppedMarketOrder(orderCount=20, duration=10m, position=1000);
}
```
